// blob-store.mjs — durable blob storage with pending/adopted lifecycle.
//
// WRITE-COORDINATOR RED-LINE (S1/A5): blob METADATA writes enter through the
// platform write coordinator (write-queue.ts) via the CALLER'S coordinated
// transaction — never a transaction this module opens itself. `adopt` takes a
// db/txn handle and runs its UPDATE in that (already coordinated) transaction;
// `upload` is invoked from callers inside a coordinator turn (the /blobs HTTP
// route wraps it in .run; the pending-blob staged write is already inside
// .run), and `discard`/`discardPending`/`reap` are likewise called only from
// coordinated framework paths (pending-blob lifecycle, the blob reaper sweep).
// This module issues no BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK and owns no transaction control
// of its own.
//
// Upload writes atomically to a pending slot with computed hashes, then records
// a 'pending' row. Caller adopts in their txn (status → 'adopted'), then
// finalizes out-of-band (promote pending → final) via the cursor-backed
// blob-finalize consumer (blob-lifecycle.mjs) — crash recovery for a missed
// finalize replays from committed events, not from a reaper scan. The reaper
// here sweeps orphans/danglers only: bytes with no committed-event trail to
// replay from (an abandoned upload, or bytes a removed row no longer
// references).
//
// This module fuses METADATA (the BlobStore table) + LIFECYCLE (the
// pending→adopt→finalize state machine, the reaper's orphan/dangler sweep).
// The BYTE storage — where the bytes physically live — is delegated to an
// injected byte store (`bytes`), defaulting to fsBlobs (seam-review §2.2). Only
// the byte half is swappable; lifecycle + metadata are framework invariants.
//
// S6/A5 (workbench#94) adds: GENERATION REPLACEMENT (replace stages new bytes,
// switchReplacement atomically switches the owning reference inside the
// caller's coordinated turn, a failed switch leaves the old generation readable
// and authoritative, and the reaper reclaims a replaced generation only once it
// is unreferenced AND the named 'replaced-generation' retention elapsed);
// DURABLE CLEANUP STATE (a failed byte deletion is recorded on the row —
// cleanupError/cleanupAttempts — retried by the next sweep, and never reported
// complete until the pending slot, final slot, and metadata row are verified
// gone); RECYCLE ROUTING (replaced and dangling generations are binned through
// the S1/A6 recycle seam BEFORE live bytes are removed, so retained backups
// move their copies into the recoverable bin); and the LOW-DISK GUARD (new
// uploads are refused below a configurable free-disk headroom, fail closed).
//
// `workbench({ blobs: { root } })` constructs fsBlobs internally (back-compat —
// an explicit root, refused on overlap with the owned directory);
// `workbench({ blobs: byteStore })` accepts any conforming byte-store object
// (the deployment reality for a photos app is S3-compatible storage — a future
// `s3Blobs({...})` implements the same interface). With NO blobs config, a
// file-mode app's byte store roots under the owned directory's managed
// `blobs/` + `staging/` pair (S6/A2 relocation — inside the owned directory
// when one exists, beside the db file otherwise; a relative database path
// makes the owned directory cwd-relative, so the root can be cwd-relative in
// that case). A memory database uses the in-memory fake store (S6/A1).
