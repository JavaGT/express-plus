// Field-level admission (S5/A3 — read projection, write rejection, proposed
// transition).
//
// The field policy rides the SAME authority as the row paths: the injected A2
// authorization adapter decides when one is wired (its fieldCapabilities seam),
// otherwise the framework field `.can` / strong-inherit engine (mayFieldOp /
// mayRow) runs, unchanged. Three concerns live here:
//
//   1. mayReadField / readableFieldNames — the one read-admission authority
//      projectRowForRecipient and its live and snapshot call sites consume.
//      A field the principal cannot read is omitted from every recipient
//      projection (or redacted to an explicit placeholder for annotated text).
//   2. annotatedTextDeniedPlaceholder — the explicit recipient-projection
//      placeholder an unreadable annotated-text field projects to. It is the
//      same frozen wire shape the existing recipient projection
//      (projectAnnotatedTextForRecipient) produces for a fully-restricted
//      document, so clients that understand the recipient grammar already
//      render it; no canonical document facts are loaded or disclosed.
//   3. admitRowTransition — proposed-transition mutation admission. Update and
//      delete admission evaluates the row `.can` / field access against the
//      CURRENT row AND the proposed AFTER row (after when present, else the
//      before row — a delete/revoke keeps its stable anchor as `before`), so an
//      update that moves a row out of the principal's scope is rejected even
//      though the current row is in scope.
//   4. admitInferenceFields — the sort/filter/count inference-prevention gate.
//      A field the principal cannot read cannot be a sort key, filter key, or
//      counted dimension; unreadable and nonexistent fields are
//      indistinguishable (spec 3a, wired by A2 into dispatchCrud).
//
// Principal-absent (null) is the row-grant's trusted query API convention: not
// a request path — skip field authz (mirrors mayVerb running only in dispatch).
