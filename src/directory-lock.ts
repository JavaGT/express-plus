// directory-lock.ts — OS-backed ownership lock for an adapter-owned directory
// (epic scope#23, S1/A2; consideration #9).
//
// MECHANISM: the adapter owns a directory by holding a sidecar SQLite lock
// database (`lock.sqlite`) in BEGIN EXCLUSIVE for the process lifetime. SQLite's
// rollback-journal RESERVED lock is the authority: while the owner holds the
// uncommitted exclusive transaction, a second process cannot acquire RESERVED
// and fails at BEGIN EXCLUSIVE with SQLITE_BUSY (after a short busy window).
// The OS releases the held lock automatically when the owning process dies — a
// crash cannot strand the directory, and no kill(pid,0) liveness probing is
// involved. The `{ pid, startedAt }` row is informational only.
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT WAL: in WAL mode BEGIN EXCLUSIVE defers contention to the
// first write, so two processes could both hold the transaction open. The lock
// database stays in rollback-journal (DELETE) mode so the exclusive transaction
// contends at begin.
//
// A PID-file-only design is explicitly rejected here (stale PID files on crash
// require probing to recover); the held transaction needs no recovery.
