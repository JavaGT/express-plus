// search-auth.ts — the S4/A6 search AUTHORIZATION seam.
//
// Authorization for search runs at TWO boundaries (considerations #14/#15),
// both through the S5/A2 authorization adapter — never a second authority:
//
//   1. BEFORE SOURCE-SCOPE SELECTION — the principal must pass the search
//      scope gate before any plugin query runs. The adapter's RESOURCE
//      admission is row-conditional (a named resource without a candidate row
//      denies 'no-row-scope' — a row-less scope admit cannot be expressed), so
//      the pre-scope gate is deliberately COARSE and still adapter-backed: the
//      plugin's searchable scope must be registered on the adapter (the seam
//      tracks what it registered — the adapter exposes no registration query),
//      and the principal must pass the route gate (requireUser by default: a
//      revoked/non-active principal collapses to anonymous and denies at the
//      boundary — no status oracle). A pre-scope denial fails fast: no plugin
//      query runs, and nothing is 500-leaked.
//
//   2. BEFORE RETURNING EACH PROTECTED RESULT/EXCERPT — every candidate row is
//      admitted through the adapter's registered search scope (the row's
//      visibility is re-verified against the CURRENT registered scope under the
//      COLLAPSED principal). Deny → omit. Index-time authorization is NEVER
//      assumed current: a result whose access changed after indexing (ownership
//      transferred, principal revoked) re-admits against the current row and
//      principal, so the index cannot serve stale authorization (spec 2).
//
// The registered scope is the principal-aware SEARCHABLE SOURCE SCOPE — the
// same shape as a plugin's declared source interest, but written against the
// source entity's fields (is.owner()/is.collaborator()/field predicates). It
// compiles to constrained SQL at registration (a non-compilable scope refuses
// the whole declaration, mirroring S5/A2), and per-result admission
// re-verifies each row against that compiled scope. Field-level excerpt
// admission runs through the entity field `.can` seam (S5/A3) so an excerpt is
// never carved from a field the principal cannot read.
