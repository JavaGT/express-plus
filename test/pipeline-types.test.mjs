// Phase 1 — Action and Event are distinct branded types (SPEC §7).
//
// An ACTION is an imperative client request that MAY be rejected. An EVENT is a
// past-tense fact the server emitted; it already happened. The two are not
// assignable to each other, and an event type declared with NO REDUCER is a
// LOAD-TIME ERROR (the reducer is non-optional) — there is no way to land an
// event in client state except by folding it through its reducer (the one
// reconciliation path, AGENTS.md).
//
// These are the irreducible type invariants the rest of the pipeline builds on.
// Source of truth: SPEC §7. House rule: distinguish similar-but-different
// concepts with distinct names — an action and an event look alike (both carry a
// type + payload) but are different facts, so they brand differently.
